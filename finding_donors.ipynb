    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

The number of hyperparameters is also not that high and they are straightforward to understand and easy to tune up which greatly helps in cases like overfitting. We can avoid this as most of the time there would be enough trees to get a proper prediction without any overfitting. One more point is that Random Forest algorithm randomly selects subset and features to build many decision trees and then averages the results. By doing this we get an optimal model that predicts way better and efficient than a single decision tree. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **(C):** The main limitation or disadvantage of a Random Forest model is that a large number of trees can make the moel slow & ineffective for real-time predictions. In general, these single (tree)algorithms are fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once it is trained. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **(D):** Number of entries are around 45k which makes random forest can train much better and create good amount of trees to make a good prediction. Also, we did some changes on the data set and changed categorcial data into numeric. Generally RF model does well when it comes to categorical data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Boosting Ensemble method - AdaBoost:** \n",
    "    **(A):** Boosting another method for ensembling multiple models to get optimal results. Along with our recommendation system it also helps in finding atheletes performances. I have found one such study. E.g. (https://uni-obuda.hu/journal/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **(B):** Boosting ensembles also perform well in practice. They are flexible to outliers, scalable, and can model non-linear decision boundaries because of their hierarchical structure. It goes a bit deep compared to bagging models and fixes the errors made my the model iteratively. when it takes decision tree as it's weak learner and information gathered at each stage of the AdaBoost algorithm about the relative 'hardness' of each training sample is fed into the tree growing algorithm such that later trees tend to focus on examples which are harder-to-classify .\n",
    "\n",
    "    **(C):** Relatively high training time, over-fitting if the data sample is too small. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **(D):** We have a clean, high amount of data a good situation to use adaBoost.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression:** \n",
    "    **(A):** Predictive analytics i.e. forecasting future opportunities and risks is the most prominent application of regression analysis in business. Stock market solution, ad marketing strategy i.e. Demand analysis which predicts the number of items which a consumer will probably purchase, Business decisions etc. are few of the many applcation where we mostly use Logistic Regression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **(B):** Very fast in training and prediction time, provides good results in case of less features. However in our case we have decent amount of features to use logistic regression properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **(C):** It assumes linear decision boundary, cannot decode complex relationships between features. It can however have complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **(D):** Simple algorithm easy to implement, hence selected it.\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we see the graphs above we can see 3 patterns for our 3 choosen model. First we can see for **Random Forest classifier** the model training time tooke considerably less compared to my boosting algorithm and also the prediciting time is pretty much similar to training time. The accuracy and F-beta score on this model is significantly higher scoring nearing 1 compared to the other two models, however while on the testing set the accuracy andd F - beta score is considerably low which means that the model is not doing great when it comes to generalizing the data, i.e. overfitting. However it's not doing great on the test data out-of the box, we can tune that and have a great result just by tuning the hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For **AdaBoost** the training and model predicting time is pretty high compared to other two models. However that is expected as it works sequentially and correcting the weightage of the misclassified errors and thus giving us a model which has high accuracy and and f beta score also generalizes very well on the testing data as well. Again we could still make this better just by tuning the hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. For **Logistic Regression** the time for training and actually predicting both on 100% training/testing data is pretty low also it generalize well between training subset and testing set, however being said that accuracy on training data is a bit low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've seen three models and how it performed based on this AdaBoost seems the best fit and it checks all the metrics for choosing the algorithm, it generalize well, with slight tweaks in the hyperparameter it'll give us a great result. However, Logistic regression can also be taken into consideration as it trains and predicts the model very much fast however accuracy and F beta score takes a hit. This we can make it better using grid search."

    "Before I explain **AdaBoost** there is a need for me to explain certain terms as to how it helps AdaBoost work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first would be something called **Decision trees(DT)** which are just generally a very good fit for boosting, more than any other algorithms, And what exactly a decision tree is? *A decision tree is a graphical representation of all the possible outcomes to a decision based on certain conditions. It's called a tree because it starts with a single box or root(node), which then branches off to a number of outcomes, just like a tree. Decision trees are helpful because they help us to see what we are thinking, One example would be calling customer care and a bot would guide us to press 1 or 2 and so on until we reach our end goal of speaking with the customer care executive. This is a very simple example of decision tree. It is also non - linear that means it can deal with more than straight line.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we have a group of people who are good at their specific domain and we ask them to answer some multiple choice questions test they'll do great in their domain specific questions however they might not do that good in other domains, which they might end up guessing. These each individuals we can call them **weak learners**. So if we combine all the weak learners and ensemble them we get a great result in our test of MCQs. In machine learning a weak learner is any machine learning algorithm that gives better accuracy(by knowing more about any specific feature/class) than simply guessing. So one algorithm could do better at understanding and predicting a certain class or feature/s but might not for other features. That algorithm would be a weak learner because it is better than guessing. If we have an algorithm that answers same for all the mcqs, then it's same as guessing and so it won't be a weak learner. For any boosting problems, the best weak learners are ones that are very accurate. For example if my algorithm answers correctly only math related mcqs would be good, this won't solve my entire problem but this would be a limited scope for my problem. But it still gives me most of my math problem's solution with great ccuracy, allowing other weak learners(Algorithm's) to focus on the remaining domain/subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From point 2, we have understood the fact that our boosting algorithms typically work by solving a small part of the problem, using previous predictors issues and fixing on their issues(Underfitted, misclassified data) so future boosting iterations can solve the remaining sections.The weak learners are best combined in a way that allows each algorithm to solve a small sub-section of the problem. Any machine learning algorithms can be used as a weak learner like SVM, Logistic Regression etc but we most commonly choose decision tree as our weak learner. The reasons are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "        A. As mentioned in point 1, DTs are non - linear hence it can tackle with non - linear data as well.\n",
    "        B. DTs are faster to train. \n",
    "        C. Most of the time a DT would work fine without changing much the hyperparameters(Tuning switches that helps how a decision tree would grow). Our weak learner needs to be high in accuracy meaning it just can't do random guessing. Now if we choose any other algorithm like a SVM which relies on parameter search. Our data is re-weighted on each iteration so we have to do another parameter search and so on. This would be very tedious and unpractical with huge aount of data. \n",
    "        D. Genrally tree basesd algorithms are prone to overfitting but by changing the depth we can have control over the bias/variance trade off which will help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In Adaboost algorithm 1 first base classifier e.g. DT would be trained and used to make predictions on the training data and then it checks where it has predicted badly i.e. our weak learners, and then a second weak learner would correct prediction of those instances in the next round of training by adding the weightage of the misclassifed points and train and make prediction again and so on. With each round, the model finds the best learner to incorporate into the ensemble, repeating this process till we can’t improve the predictions anymore. All these weak learners are then combined to make a final ensembled model, where they each vote to predict if a person earns more than 50k or not. This voting process is known as *'Hard voting'* where we take the majority of the votes to make a final prediction. we can also have something called *'soft voting'* where we would use the probability method(Predict_proba hyperparameter) of the algorithm it self to make a prediction. Using this model with the census information of individuals, we can predict for a new donor who earns more than 50K or not therefore making a decision on the likelihood of them donating to charity for ML. So our weak learners will check each features into consideration and make model based on them. So if one weak learner does a great job of finding a high accuracy using 'capital_loss' feature and others like 'capital_gain', 'age' etc. So we have good accuracies from each of the weak learners and using them we would predict the income of those people with greater than $50k.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression** works by measuring the relationship between the categorical dependent variable*(Target feature, in our case the people who would like to donate the money)* and one or more independent variables*(remaining features we are going to use to predict the target class)* i.e. it makes predictions using probability by estimating probabilities using a logistic function. (Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this logistic function we can fit our data into the algorithm and we would look for the probability which if greater than or equals to 0.5 the person is more likely to give the donation for charity and less than 0.5 is not. This is if we have scores(independent variable, in our case 'income'), we know whether a person will donate or npt(dependent variable, i.e. more than 50K or not). This then come up with predictions and we take a look at how we predicted with our recorded data."

    "**Answer:** From the visualisation persprective it is clear that feature 'occupation' doesn't have much effect on income which is strange as I believe a persons income depends on their job or business i.e. their source of truth for income. Also, capital loss and gain and age seems to have a good feature weight however to me hours per week seems a bit cloudy as many of the person who's having 40 hours as their HPW earns less than 50k and sometimes they earn more than 50k so there's a grey line there. However I can conclude that my prediction of features were accurate except HPW."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
